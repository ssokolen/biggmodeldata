## About the project

The aim of this package is to enable offline lookups of BIGG model data (currently limited to reactions). The code basically serves as a thin wrapper for database creation and access.

### Disclaimer
This is a work in progress meant to fill a gap in our lab's workflow. Use at your own risk.

### Current status
Further updates may be added as required by ongoing work.

## Installation

Install directly from GitHub (or clone and install locally):

```sh
python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/ssokolen/biggmodeldata
```
## Data source

Data distributed with this package was obtained from the [BIGG website]. Usage of the underlying data is governed by the following:

## Usage

There are currently 5 basic functions oriented around reaction IDs:

```python

from biggmodeldata import reactions as r

# Look-up reaction IDs based on EC number
r.ids("1.3.5.1")

# Look-up EC numbers corresponding to a reaction ID
r.ecs("SUCD1")

# Look-up reaction reactants as a list of (stoichiometry, id) tuples
# Note that reactant stoichiometric coefficients are negative
r.reactants("SUCD1")

# Look-up reaction products as a list of (stoichiometry, id) tuples
r.products("SUCD1")

# Look-up all alternatives to a reaction id, defined as reactions involving
# the same core metabolites (ignore cofactors and energetic compounds like ATP)
r.alternatives("SUCD1")
```

Metabolite IDs may be expanded in the future, but for now, the metabolites module only serves to define a set of "helpers", molecules like ATP and NADH that assist enzymatic function without carrying mass flux.

```python

from biggmodeldata import metabolites as m

# Note that helpers are defined across all possible compartments whether
# this makes biological sense or not, so the list is a bit long
m.helpers()
```

The package is distributed with data included, but you can use the `update_reactions` function to rebuild the databases based on the reaction lists provided by the [BIGG website]. Warning, this step hasn't been optimized and may take a couple of hours.

```python

import biggmodeldata as bigg

bigg.update_reactions()
```
